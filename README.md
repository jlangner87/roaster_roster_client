### **_Description_**

#### I am a coffee connoisseur. I love it. I need it.

#### I particularly enjoy filling my bean hopper with unique small batch roasts from independently owned roasteries. The problem is that they are difficult to find. They are typically buried under the large corporate operations with massive advertisement budgets.

#### **_Enter WikiBean!_**

This is an app for 4 types of users.
- The Roaster
- The Retailer
- The Brewer (upcoming release)
- The Connoisseur (upcoming release)

The Roaster (the roasterie owner) can set up a profile for their roasterie. On that profile, they can keep an up to date (fully mutable) list of the beans they are roasting with details.

The Retailer (the store owner/manager) can browse roasteries, make supplier/retailer relations with the Roasters, and even list the collections of beans that they sell at their location.

The Brewer has the same functionality as the retailer with one  key difference. This model tells 

The Connoisseur (the average Joe who just loves a good cup of Joe) can also browse the beans by collection. The application uses the "Bean" model attributes to sort the beans into easily browsable collections based off of the attributes

### **Future Development Opportunity (Post MVP)**

#### Brewer and Connoisseur models

#### Additional Bean attributes
- Fair-Trade
- Good Causes
- Non-Profit
- Decaf
- Veteran Owned

#### A feature that lets users rate individual bean roasts on a scale of 1-5 beans. Then add a "Top Picks collection with all beans rated 4 or 5"

#### A favoriting feature that bookmarks beans and Roasters for Retailers and Connoisseur to come back and quickly find what they already know they love.

#### Connoisseur reiwes.

#### Deep Search.
